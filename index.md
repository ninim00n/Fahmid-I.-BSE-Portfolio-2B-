# Programming My First Video Game in Unity
For this project, I decided to learn how to design, program, and render my own video game in Unity. I decided on creating a 2D game with the illusion of depth, meaning that the player character is capable of moving in all four directions and also jumping. The gameplay focuses around platforming, exploring the environment, and clearing multiple levels of enemies.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was learning the basics of programming and using Unity, which I did through a variety of Unity tutorials, watching videos of basic game-development concepts, and consulting the help of my instructor. I decided to solidify my understanding of Unity's built in physics, interaction systems, and general processes before I jumped into making full levels. Whilst learning to use Unity, I managed to figure out the basics of C# (Unity's primary programming language), learned how to render sprites and create animations, and transition between different sets of animations. I created a controllable player character and I also understand the basics of how to create interactable, physics-based levels and background objects. My next milestone is most likely going to be based around learning how to code enemy AI, coding enemies to recognize and target the player when in a certain range of each other, and implement simple combat with a health system. I would also like to work on creating floorplans of some levels using the assets I have in Unity.
